**Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.**

GPT Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt.

[Demo](https://twitter.com/antonosika/status/1667641038104674306) â€” [Documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Project philosophy

- Simple to get value
- Flexible and easy to add new own "AI steps". See `steps.py`.
- Incrementally build towards a user experience of:
  1. high level prompting
  2. giving feedback to the AI that it will remember over time
- Fast handovers back and forth between AI and human
- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem

## Usage

Choose either **stable** or **development**.

For **stable** release:

- `python -m pip install gpt-engineer`

For **development**:
- `git clone https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer.git`
- `cd gpt-engineer`
- `python -m pip install -e .`
  - (or: `make install && source venv/bin/activate` for a venv)

**API Key**
Either just:
- `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`

Or:
- Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`
- Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
- (advanced) Use a local model, see [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html).

Check the [Windows README](./WINDOWS_README.md) for windows usage.

**Running**

- Create an empty folder. If inside the repo, you can run:
  - `cp -r projects/example/ projects/my-new-project`
- Fill in the `prompt` file in your new folder
- `gpt-engineer projects/my-new-project`
  - (Note, `gpt-engineer --help` lets you see all available options. For example `--steps use_feedback` lets you improve/fix code in a project)

By running gpt-engineer you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).

**Azure OpenAI Service**

You'll set your Azure OpenAI KEY 1 or KEY 2 as:
- `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`

Then you call `gpt-engineer` with your service endpoint `--azure https://aoi-resource-name.openai.azure.com` and set your deployment name (which you created in the Azure AI Studio) as the model name. Example: `gpt-engineer --azure https://myairesource.openai.azure.com ./projects/example/ my-gpt4-deployment-name`

**Results**

Check the generated files in `projects/my-new-project/workspace`

**Alternatives**

You can check [Docker instructions](docker/README.md) to use Docker, or simply
do everything in your browser:

## Features

You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the `preprompts` folder.

Editing the `preprompts`, and evolving how you write the project prompt, is how you make the agent remember things between projects.

Each step in `steps.py` will have its communication history with GPT4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with `scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py`.

You can also run with open source models, like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.


## Vision
The gpt-engineer community is building the **open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox**.
