This script checks if it is being run as the main module and then starts the Uvicorn server with the FastAPI app. The server listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and port `8000`.

Additionally, we need to update the Dockerfile to ensure that the new script is correctly utilized when the Docker container is run. We will change the CMD directive to use `run.py` instead of directly calling `uvicorn`.
