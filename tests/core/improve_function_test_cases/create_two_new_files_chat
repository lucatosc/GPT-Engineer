To implement the requested functionality, we'll create a Python program that processes the input, evaluates the service history of a car, and outputs the appropriate message based on the criteria provided. We'll structure the program into several parts:

1. **Parsing Input**: A function to parse the input string into a structured format.
2. **Service History Evaluation**: A class to evaluate the service history entries and determine the status of the odometer and service frequency.
3. **Main Logic**: The main logic that ties everything together and outputs the final result.

Let's start by creating the necessary files and writing the initial code.

### File: requirements.txt
This file will list the dependencies required for the project. Since the project does not require external libraries, this file will be empty but included for completeness.

```diff
```

### File: service_history_evaluator.py
This file will contain the class responsible for evaluating the service history.
