Planning:

1. Refactor the DNS logic to ensure that DNS records are created for every server hostname and sent to every domain controller. This involves creating a function that encapsulates the DNS record creation logic and iterates over all domain controllers to apply the changes.

2. Remove redundant logic and checks that are scattered throughout the DNS section of the script. Consolidate the logic into a single, reusable function.

3. Replace the multiple if-else statements that determine the `$Zone` variable with a more efficient method, possibly using a hashtable or a switch statement to map server domains to their respective zones.

4. Ensure that the script follows PowerShell best practices, such as using approved verbs for function names, providing comment-based help, and using try-catch blocks for error handling.

5. Add comprehensive comments to the new function and throughout the DNS logic to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

6. Test the refactored DNS logic to ensure it works correctly in various scenarios and that DNS records are created and propagated as expected.

Now, let's generate the diffs for the changes:
