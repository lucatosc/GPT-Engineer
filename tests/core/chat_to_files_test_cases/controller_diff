Planning:

1. Modify the `handle_input` method within the `Controller` class to change the behavior of the snake when certain keys are pressed.
2. When the "up" key is pressed, we need to queue two actions: first to move "down" and then to move "right" after one step. This will require storing the next move in the `Controller` class and checking for it on subsequent calls to `handle_input`.
3. When the "down" key is pressed, the snake should move "up".
4. When the "left" key is pressed, the snake should move "right".
5. When the "right" key is pressed, the snake should move "left".
6. Remove the long, unnecessary comment block.
7. Since we need to queue actions, we will introduce a new attribute `next_move` to the `Controller` class to store the next move.
8. Update the `__init__` method to initialize `next_move` as `None`.
9. Modify the `handle_input` method to check if there is a `next_move` queued before checking the keyboard input. If there is a `next_move`, execute it and clear the `next_move`.
10. Update the `handle_input` method to set the `next_move` to "right" when the "up" key is pressed, after moving "down".
11. Update the `handle_input` method to handle the reversed directions for "down", "left", and "right" keys.
