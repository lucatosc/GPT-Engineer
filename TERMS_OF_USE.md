Both OpenAI, L.L.C. and the creators of gpt-engineer centrally store data
about how gpt-engineer is used with the sole intent of improving the capability of the product.

Care is taken to not store any information that can be tied to a person.

More information about OpenAI's terms of use [here](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

Please beware that natural text input, such as the files `prompt` and `feedback`, will be stored and can in theory be used to connect a persons style of writing or content in the file to a real person.

You can disable storing data for each by the creators of gpt-engineer, but not OpenAI, by setting the environment variable COLLECT_LEARNINGS_OPT_OUT=true.
