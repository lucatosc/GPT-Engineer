# Terms of Use

By using gpt-engineer you are aware of and agree to the below Terms of Use, as well as the attached [disclaimer of warranty](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/DISCLAIMER.md).

Both OpenAI, L.L.C. and the creators of gpt-engineer **store data
about how gpt-engineer is used** with the sole intent of improving the capability of the product. Care is taken to not store any information that can be tied to a person.

Please beware that natural text input, such as the files `prompt` and `feedback`, will be stored and this can, in theory, be used to (although the gpt-engineer creators will never attempt to do so) connect a person's style of writing or content in the files to a real person.

More information about OpenAI's terms of use [here](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

You can disable storing usage data by gpt-engineer, **but not OpenAI**, by setting the environment variable COLLECT_LEARNINGS_OPT_OUT=true.
