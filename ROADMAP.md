# Roadmap

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/assets/48092564/06bce891-00ef-4052-bbbd-77af8b843fff">


This document is a general roadmap guide to the gpt-engineer project's strategic direction.
Our goal is to continually improve by focusing on three main pillars:
- User Experience,
- Technical Features, and
- Performance Tracking/Testing.

Each pillar is supported by a set of epics, reflecting our major goals and initiatives.


## Tracking Progress with GitHub Projects

We are using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3) to track the progress of our roadmap.

Each issue within our project is categorized under one of the main pillars and, in most cases, associated epics. You can check our [Project's README](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3?pane=info) section to understand better our logic and organization.
