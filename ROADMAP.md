<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/assets/48092564/06bce891-00ef-4052-bbbd-77af8b843fff">


This document is a general roadmap guide to the gpt-engineer project's strategic direction. 
Our goal is to continually improve by focusing on three main pillars: 
- User Experience, 
- Technical Features, and 
- Performance Tracking/Testing. 

Each pillar is supported by a set of epics, reflecting our major goals and initiatives.

## Main Pillars and Epics
### üë• User Experience

- **Easy installation** - We are committed to ensuring our solution is accessible, with straightforward installation and clear instructions, complemented by Docker image instructions.

- **Optimized workflows** - Our focus is on optimizing human-in-the-loop workflows to enhance productivity and ease of use.

- **Git integration** - We facilitate seamless version control with automatic Git integration.

- **Up-to-date documentation** - Providing concise, automatically updated documentation, including a practical Cookbook to help users make the most of gpt-engineer.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features
- **Self-healing code** - Development of advanced self-healing code features to increase resilience and improve the general quality of generated code.

- **Test generation** - Implementing automatic test generation to streamline development and ensure code reliability.

- **Algorithm integration** - Establishing a pipeline for integrating the latest algorithms from research, keeping us at the cutting edge.

- **Startup partnerships** - We are interested in forging partnerships with startups to utilize and showcase our technical features, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.


### üìä Performance Tracking/Testing
- **Test coverage in CI** - Achieving complete test coverage in Continuous Integration (CI), including compatibility with various Python versions and Docker.
- **Benchmark suite** - Creating a comprehensive benchmark suite, including SWE-bench, APPS, and more, to measure and improve performance.
- **Infrastructure for benchmarks** - Setting up dedicated infrastructure for periodic benchmark evaluation to ensure consistent performance.
- **Benchmark scoreboard** - Introducing a public benchmark scoreboard that is open to other agents, including time trace for transparent and competitive performance tracking.


## Tracking Progress with GitHub Projects

We are using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3) to track the progress of our roadmap.

Each issue within our project is categorized under one of the main pillars and, in most cases, associated epics.

The issues can be in various states:

- **Backlog** - Ideas and tasks waiting to be prioritized.
- **Todo** - Tasks that are prioritized and planned for the upcoming sprints.
- **In Progress** - Work that is actively being developed or implemented.
- **Done** - Completed tasks that have met our definition of done.
- **Discarded** - Tasks or ideas that have been considered but are not proceeding.



## Organizing issues and roadmap with views

The gpt-engineer project's roadmap is organized into several views, each offering a unique perspective on our work and progress. These views help the team and community to understand where things stand and what is being prioritized quickly.

### General View

The **[General View](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3/views/1)** provides a comprehensive list of all issues, epics, and their current status. In this view, you can see a list of issues, their titles, pillar categorizations, epics, status, and assignees. It's a master list from which we can access any specific issue's details and track its journey from conception to completion. This high-level view is perfect for getting a snapshot of the entire project's progress at a glance.

### Kanban View

The **[Kanban View](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3/views/2)** visualizes our workflow in a traditional Kanban board format. It is divided into columns representing the state of issues from "Backlog" to "Done," allowing us to track the work flow through our development process. We see it as a dynamic tool where tasks are moved through stages, and it provides a visual representation that helps maintain the flow of tasks and promptly address any bottlenecks.

### By Pillars

The **[By Pillars](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3/views/3)** View categorizes issues under the main pillars of User Experience, Technical Features, and Performance Tracking/Testing. This view is crucial for maintaining focus on our foundational pillars. It filters issues into groups based on the pillar they contribute to, ensuring that our development efforts are evenly distributed and aligned with our strategic goals.

### By Epics

The **[By Epics](https://github.com/orgs/gpt-engineer-org/projects/3/views/4)** View organizes issues according to the epics they belong to. This detailed breakdown helps us focus on the larger goals we are working towards and manage related tasks effectively. Epics are our large-scale objectives that span multiple issues. The By Epics View allows us to filter and manage tasks that collectively contribute to a significant, overarching goal, clarifying the progression of these key initiatives.
