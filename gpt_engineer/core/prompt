Instead of letting BaseAgent derived classes hold a preprompts_path, they should hold a PrepromptsHolder object, which is instantiated with a preprompts path. Instead of passing the preprompts_path to functions, the agents should pass a preprompts_holder object. The preprompts_holder should have a function called get_preprompts with returns all preproompts as an in memory dictionary
